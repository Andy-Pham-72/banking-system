In this project, I created a simple version of a banking system which I incoporate some **Python fundamental skills**: inheritance, exception handling, logging, getter and setter methods along with **SQL database** that associates with the Python script in order to produce the csv as a type of data storage.

All the classes, methods, and functions are documented with docstring comments.

The project consist of 2 main files and 1 log file:
* 1. **banking_system.py** - source code to run the application
* 2. **banking_system.sql** - sql database script
* 3. **unknown_bank_management.log** - an example of logging
